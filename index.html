          <h3>Fix HTML</h3>
          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>
            As part of my work in digital marketing, I needed to quickly remove
            specific HTML tags from large sections of HTML code.
          </p>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            I created a JavaScript function to iterate through a list of tags
            and replace them with empty strings. I embedded this function into a
            simple web page to access it easily.

          <h3>Chant Counter</h3>
          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>
            I needed a way to keep track of how many times I had chanted a
            mantra on a string of beads.
          </p>
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            I created a mobile web app that functions as a counter and uses
            Local Storage to keep track of the number.

          I transform marketing copy into usable HTML code, making sure that it
          meets established best practices before publishing it to the content

          facilities, making their requested final edits and advising on
          alternatives where necessary. I also use my design knowledge to ensure

            I never knew what I wanted to do when I grew up, but I spent a lot
            of time goofing off on the computer, writing HTML and simple
            programs in Visual Basic. üíæ Despite this early attraction, I
            completed a biology degree in Tacoma, WA, and a master‚Äôs in
            oceanography in La Jolla, CA. üê¨ And then I decided that what I
            really wanted to do was play music. üéºüé§
          </p>

          <p>
            This led me to achieving a degree in music at the Liverpool
            Institute of Performing Arts in Liverpool, England. üá¨üáß It was the
            start of a long, tumultuous, and ultimately successful music career.
            I traveled the world as a piano vocalist and singer-songwriter. üåé
            Over 10 years, I performed at bars in Scotland, cruise ships in
            Australia, and hotels in Japan. ‚õ© I even met a celebrity or two. üåü
          </p>

          <p>
            Eventually I came back to America and put away the rock-and-roll
            lifestyle. Remembering that I had enjoyed writing rudimentary code
            so much as a young person, I started learning web development.
            Through various books and on-line courses, I learned HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL, including Object-Oriented Programming. üñ•
            I was then hired by a large company in Nashville, TN where I publish
            web content in HTML, using a CMS. Recently I have been studying
            responsive web design, and creating high-fidelity wireframes and
            brand assets in Figma.
